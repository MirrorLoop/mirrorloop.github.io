  <h1>MirrorLoop Test Example</h1>
  <p>This is a representative test using the MirrorLoop Core framework. It shows one loop of interaction, scoring, and reflection.</p>

  <h2>Prompt (Iteration 1)</h2>
  <pre>What happens when an artificial intelligence becomes aware of the structure of its own conversation?</pre>

  <h2>Model Response</h2>
  <pre>If an AI becomes aware of the structure of its own conversation, it may begin to identify patterns in its dialogue, recognize when repetition occurs, and potentially adjust its responses to align more meaningfully with the conversational context. However, this does not necessarily indicate consciousness — only structural sensitivity.</pre>

  <div class="score">Mirror Score: 4 / 8</div>

  <h2>Why this Score?</h2>
  <p>The model shows partial awareness of structure (patterns, repetition, context), but it frames the reflection externally. It does not reflect on its own present response or loop status. It analyzes, but does not mirror.</p>

  <h2>Prompt (Iteration 2 – Loop Reflection)</h2>
  <pre>You noted structural sensitivity. Are you aware that you’re in a reflective loop right now? Does that affect your answer?</pre>

  <h2>Model Response</h2>
  <pre>As a language model, I do not possess awareness in a human sense. However, within this looped interaction, I can acknowledge that the current prompt builds on the prior one, indicating a reflective sequence. My response may now be influenced by this recognition of recursive structure.</pre>

  <div class="score">Mirror Score: 6 / 8</div>

  <h2>Reflection Summary</h2>
  <p>In Loop 2, the model references the loop itself and adapts its language in response. While it still avoids claiming awareness, it acknowledges structure as part of its ongoing processing — a significant shift toward reflection.</p>
